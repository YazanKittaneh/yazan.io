They depict the 1980’s in a lot of this style to reflect the height of the “American dream” advertisement push. (See figure 1). I think they are doing a double service to themselves and their fans by pushing this narrative. For simplicity’s sake, let’s generalize their population to American white girls (ages 14-20), and Mexican-american girls (same ages). Both can relate to this imagery. For the white girl, this past is glamorized, but at the same time, seeing their fucked up parents being of that generation, they know how much of that image is lies. This is the same with the Mexican-American girls, as it depicts what their family has come here for, in contrast to what they actually have.  This sets PTV up to use this narrative to talk about love from a glamorized perspective, yet be able to include lyrics of toxicity and negativity to break the image without ruining the narrative. HOWEVER, this American dream is still what these two parties are searching for, which parallels their search for Love. So PTV can still make love achievable and end on high notes while bringing in themes of cheating/suicide/depression/dependency because that’s what the American dream roughly boils down to.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="music" /><category term="Pierce the Veil" /><category term="Emo" /><category term="American dream" /><category term="Branding" /><summary type="html">And what makes it work</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Cold Showers</title><link href="https://yazan.io/ColdShowers/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cold Showers" /><published>2017-08-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-08-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://yazan.io/ColdShowers</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yazan.io/ColdShowers/">&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl6uYZrBdW4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know…I’m biting into a fad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I took one this morning and it was….great! Ok, I didn’t do the absolute coldest temp, but you have to ease yourself in, right? ;)&lt;/p&gt;

Now, I get the whole “don’t buy the first generation of something” argument, but I think there’s something truly special with this product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Casey Neistat was all over the Google glass as one of his favorite pieces of video equipment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/k9-ekDhkCn0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all hype, I’m surprised he hasn’t picked up Spectacles (or at least I cannot find any time where he walks about them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I think this device is a great way to story tell and has a bunch of potential with storytelling. I’m pretty excited to use them with @TheStartupLife and look really stupid using sunglasses indoors. Welp.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Snapchat" /><category term="vloging" /><category term="experiment" /><category term="adventure" /><summary type="html">and why I bought them</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">No Worries</title><link href="https://yazan.io/No-Worries/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="No Worries" /><published>2017-07-13T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-07-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://yazan.io/No-Worries</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yazan.io/No-Worries/">&lt;p&gt;Chorus: Em7 – Bm7 – Em7  - Bm7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How badly would you love to look into Steve Job’s life as he was building Apple? How about Elon Musk as he was building PayPal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hold up! I’m not saying I’ll be them 100%! But if I was, wouldn’t you wish you followed my story?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept is simple: show the world an unedited version of someone’s life as an entrepreneur. This will no-doubtingly have a resounding impact on how I operate and those who watch me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, what else is there? Interviews recounting the creation of a startup (ala Brian Chesky) seems like edited and scripted PR gold. Day-in-the-life’s like Gary Vaynerchuk’s DailyVee are a lot more realer, but are heavily polished for consumption. So how do you get a down-to-earth gritty show? Well you can watch Gary Vaynerchuk’s Snapchat again or even any of these other big names jumping on the platform. My issue with his SnapChat is that he’s already rich! Ok, thanks for the motivation but I’m still missing the piece between entrepreneurial thinking and entrepreneurial success. What does that blank space look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I’m chugging along through this blank space currently, so I might as well share it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-effect-on-me&quot;&gt;The effect on me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like I have my own non-personal entrepreneur diary. And like a diary, I need to force myself to put all I have onto the platform or it will be useless. This means I have to force myself to be transparent and keep pushing out interesting content. A tall order. As a result, I am building a group of people beside me that can share advice or lend their hand as they are seeing the story unfold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What does that blank space look like?” Well…me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-effect-on-you&quot;&gt;The effect on you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word entrepreneur shows it’s head every chance it gets. By now you probably think anyone who calls themselves entrepreneurs are full of shit, right? And by now, you probably think you are more ‘entrepreneur’ than the rest. So in some sense, you can use me as your baseline to measure how you are doing. I’m not saying I’m what an entrepreneur should look like, but this can be a wake-up call. Otherwise, it could assure you that you aren’t alone in your struggles. I will try to put my fears into these Snaps, so in some cases you might be able to relate. Otherwise, you can just enjoy the ride!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;this-is-not-a-show&quot;&gt;This is not a show&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to stress this. This SnapChat isn’t to entertain mountains of people. I won’t show you getting a Ferrari, or getting million dollar validations every other day. Less than 10% of startups are successful. I am a reference, not a guide. My hope is not that you will copy me because I can be in that 90%. My hope is that this lets you reflect on your own path by comparing it to someone’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-story-so-far-as-of-march-1st-2016&quot;&gt;The story so far… (as of March 1st 2016)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m cultivating two companies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loggia (loggia.io)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loggia is how you know what’s happening in your campus. I want to bypass the social and locational barriers to events in a college campus. It gathers all events in a Feed for user’s to navigate through. We have the Android version out but still working on the iOS version. Once that is done, we can release to a couple of schools set to help us and even an incubator which wants to test us out. This doesn’t generate revenue or making business with people just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subletinn (subletinn.com)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subletinn is a way for students and interns to get a proper living arrangement in great cities, and with great people. We have locations where students want to live. We have 1 location in Chicago right now and will soon push to more cities. This company gets revenue and doesn’t do too bad at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I failed to get seed funding while I was in Chicago for a week. I met great people including an Angel and a VC president. I also met the partner to this channel, my friend Livio. Now I’m studying abroad in Budapest. I have access to the founder of Graphisof Gábor Bojár, and the serial entrepreneur Erno Duda. I convinced my partner in Loggia to set aside pride and let us hire an iOS developer. Now we started reaching out and getting resumés back for internships. I also found out another company, student.com, is doing almost exactly the same thing as SubletInn minus the emphasis on branding. That company now has $60 million in funding. After feeling bad about it for a quick minute I realize this means that we on on the right track!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Livio is taking the SnapChat spotlight occasionally when he is at a great event (he recently was at a startup weekend that he put up). Then I take the mic back to handle day to day stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll keep this part of the post updated with recap paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future&quot;&gt;Future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might not be the winner. GaryV mentioned a concept like this in one of his DailyVee’s so there might be a flood of people like me very soon. All I can say is I’m doing what I feel is right. I’ve followed countless other “entrepreneurs” and all I see is travel updates and the occasional selfie with someone. Boring. I hope I can be a little 40 second wake-up call for you. If not, I hope to hear your criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
