... So I bought the Snapchat Spectacles. Now, I get the whole "don't buy the first generation of something" argument, but I think there's something truly special with this product.


Firstly, Casey Neistat was all over the Google glass as one of his favorite pieces of video equipment:

With all hype, I'm surprised he hasn't picked up Spectacles (or at least I cannot find any time where he walks about them).

Anyway, I think this device is a great way to story tell and has a bunch of potential with storytelling. I'm pretty excited to use them with @TheStartupLife and look really stupid using sunglasses indoors. Welp.
